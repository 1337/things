<p>(20:59) [KGV'08] blai: weirdest dream ever, with an extremely sad ending</p>
<p>so it begins roughly with you sending me a picture of a piece of toast in my dream, that somehow means i have to go to your house to check it out</p>
<p>i went to your place, which looks more like my place in real life, to check out the piece of toast</p>
<p>and somehow, instead of checking out the piece of toast, i went into your house and went to the basement (?)</p>
<p>right in front of the unfurnished stairs was a rack a stainless steel, white paint coated rack</p>
<p>on the rack i saw a dozen different necklaces they all have a cross on them (the jesus cross, not the tic tac toe cross)</p>
<p>some come with picture frames and in those picture frames are pictures of crosses</p>
<p>of course i went "wtf", since you aren't a christian right?</p>
<p>the moment i did that, i got teleported to the second floor of your house</p>
<p>every piece of furniture on the floor looked like flat pieces of white plastic</p>
<p>they look as if they are foldable</p>
<p>a voice says that they are guest rooms</p>
<p>a moment after that, i somehow got back to the first floor without realising</p>
<p>looking at the living room the living room has well lit windows and looks like it's from the 1990s</p>
<p>there's a stereo on the coffee table your dad (who was unsurprisingly korean, and an image of a korean friend of mine... called mike) told me to go downstairs to the basement again he didn't go down himself so i went and found (other than the rack of necklaces) a hi-fi room it was dark in the basement so i pressed what i thought was a light switch one of the stereo equipments made a deafening sound, so i thought i broke something in there and got the hell out of the basement without even checking out the piece of toast, i got out of your place and got on a bus looking out through the windows, i saw ngau tau kok, where i grew up in hk somehow it was snowing it looked like christmas time, but obviously hk doesn't snow two kids were on the bus, wearing nothing but huge, brown, furry diapers they were playing with each other, pressing one of those "stop" buttons you find in buses you know those buttons can't be pressed again until the driver resets it every time he opens the doors yeah? in my dream, it kept getting pressed every time the kids pressed it, it made a bike bell sound the driver got to the back of the bus and stopped the kids the bus was still driving itself the kids stopped playing with the bells (21:10) Jessica: this is an extremely vivid recollection that you have...just saying (21:11) [KGV'08] blai: a passenger (portrayed by Denholm Reynholm) gave the kids' father a lesson he told the father to teach his kids well that he's failing at it and that he's useless and must get off the bus he said: "you get them off now. and while you do that, you might as well also give me a million dollars on the way" father halted when he heard that sentence he seemed to have gotten mad, but not the uncontrollable mad the calm, freaky mad he took out a one-foot wooden handle, unfolded to a 2-foot, serrated blade that roughly resembles a giant steak knife on the bus it was snowing out there, but now it's sunny, with the golden sun shining through the windows the kids' father, slowly approaching the Denholm Reynholm guy, lightly touches him with the tip of the blade the tip went from the tip of Denholm Reynholm's left shoulder to where his belt was slowly, Denholm finds himself splitting with a gaping cut so deep that his organs could be seen it must have been 1-foot deep he remained calm other passengers could see him in pain he silently waited for his inevitable death passengers started crying for there was nothing we could do a cut that big, nobody can even sew him up and pretend nothing happened a male passenger next to me said "the worst part is you can't do anything to sew the brain back together" i looked back at Denholm Reynholm and saw his left side of the head cut apart too you could see his brain exposed to the air local women started taking out their camera phones and took photos i shouted "&Atilde;&yen;&iuml;&iquest;&frac12;&iuml;&iquest;&frac12;&Atilde;&yen;&Acirc;&yen;&Acirc;&frac12;&Atilde;&yen;&Acirc;&frac12;&Acirc;&plusmn;!" to give the Denholm Reynholm guy his final respect some guy who looked surprisingly like my church pastor rushed up to him and hugged him everyone followed crying they hugged and cried until that guy probably died (i couldn't see) and ends the nightmare It was also to note that this dream was in full colour.</p>
