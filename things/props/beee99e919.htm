<p>I showed my dad my results statement.<br />He asked me where I plan to go for university.<br />&ldquo;Canada,&rdquo; I replied.<br />&ldquo;You should seriously think about it,&rdquo; said father. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why [you're] doing science in Canada, particularly when a Hong Kong university has accepted you.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;m doing both science and computer science in Canada. That&rsquo;s actually twice the size of the work sector I can get into than the kind of jobs I get if I go to CUHK.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to work for others. You want others to work for you. Even the greatest scientist, 張大一, does his research using capitalist funds.&rdquo;<br />He obviously didn&rsquo;t get the &ldquo;I&rsquo;m doing computer science too&rdquo; part.<br />&ldquo;You need to open up your gateway to working opportunities.</p>
