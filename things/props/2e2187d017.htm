<p><strong>We're accidentally in love</strong> (<a href="http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/countingcrows/accidentallyinlove.html" target="_new"><em>Counting Crows - Accidentally in love</em></a>)</p>
<ul>
<li>Nobody should know they should be in love. (Unless they planned well for it or something)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(no lyrics)</strong> (<a href="http://sherifhamed.imeem.com/music/uoiha2_W/sherif_secret_love/" target="_new"><em>Sherif - Secret love</em></a>)</p>
<ul>
<li>And then you secretly admire whoever it is (not that I support beastiality - I'm just too lazy to type "him/her")</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Felt like I couldn't breathe...</strong> (<a href="http://www.metrolyrics.com/see-you-again-lyrics-miley-cyrus.html" target="_new"><em>Miley Cyrus - See you again</em></a>)</p>
<ul>
<li>First date feels like "o-sweaty-hands-and-OCD" caused by expected rise in NGF levels.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>...I will always love you</strong> (<a href="http://www.lyrics007.com/Whitney%20Houston%20Lyrics/I%20Will%20Always%20Love%20You%20Lyrics.html" target="_new"><em>Whitney Houston - I will always love you</em></a>)</p>
<ul>
<li>Time to make some promises. You will always love it and it will always love you. It may happen, it may not - but making a vow is always better than not. You are expected to lie half of the time anyway.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>And wouldn't it be nice to live together...</strong> (<a href="http://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/50_first_dates_soundtrack/beach_boys_wouldnt_it_be_nice-lyrics-214638.html" target="_new"><em>Beach Boys - Wouldn't it be nice</em></a>)</p>
<ul>
<li>Infatuation at its best. Oh my god, I wish we can get married, right now.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Though the story never ends, let's celebrate...</strong> (<a href="http://www.metrolyrics.com/seasons-of-love-lyrics-rent.html" target="_new"><em>Rent - Seasons of love</em></a>)</p>
<ul>
<li>Stability of the relationship means that you've made it. If you manage to get to this stage, you usually don't follow the steps after this one.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Hurts so bad but feels so good...</strong> (<a href="http://www.metrolyrics.com/helpless-when-she-smiles-lyrics-backstreet-boys.html" target="_new"><em>Backstreet Boys - Helpless when she smiles</em></a>)</p>
<ul>
<li>When you start realizing it hurts to love someone, maybe you should consider stopping.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Let's start over... Well try to do to it right this time around</strong> (<a href="http://www.completealbumlyrics.com/lyric/131124/Chris+Daughtry+-+It's+Not+Over.html" target="_new"><em>Chris Daughtry - It's not over</em></a>)</p>
<ul>
<li>Relationships don't come easy so let's try and save whatever we have without having to start again and do all the cheesy chasing stuff.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>It's too late to apologize, it's too late...</strong> (<a href="http://www.metrolyrics.com/apologize-lyrics-timbaland.html" target="_new"><em>Timbaland - Apologize</em></a>)</p>
<ul>
<li>Too bad, you already hurt me. Tough. If you aren't going to fix things up, apologizing is unnecessary.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>You can't make a heart love somebody</strong> (<a href="http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/You-Can't-Make-A-Heart-Love-Somebody-lyrics-George-Strait/5640E358EB07D7CE48256952000E241A" target="_new"><em>George Strait - You can't make a heart love somebody</em></a>)</p>
<ul>
<li>Rejection of offer. Lesson from the movie <em>Bruce Almighty </em>- "Love me now!" doesn't work.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>There's nothing left to say but goodbye...</strong> (<a href="http://www.lyrics007.com/Air%20Supply%20Lyrics/Goodbye%20Lyrics.html" target="_new"><em>Air Supply - Goodbye</em></a>)</p>
<ul>
<li>Goodbye. It's going to hurt us both, but goodbye anyway because it might actually feel better.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Well I'm putting my heart back together, 'Cause I got over you.</strong> (<a href="http://www.metrolyrics.com/over-you-lyrics-chris-daughtry.html" target="_new"><em>Chris Daughtry - Over you</em></a>)</p>
<ul>
<li>Congratulations, you've brought the relationship to a whole new low level.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>We agreed that it was over... I'm not supposed to love you anymore</strong> (<a href="http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/I'M-NOT-SUPPOSED-TO-LOVE-YOU-ANYMORE-lyrics-Bryan-White/F3580B9983247A8B48256910001F30B2" target="_new"><em>Bryan White - I'm not supposed to love you anymore</em></a>)</p>
