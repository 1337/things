<h4>Increase hit rate</h4>
<p>Write as much as possible when you're given space. One of them might as well  	be right.<br /> Example: Give an example of a reaction between an acid and base.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>H<sup>+</sup>+OH<sup>-</sup> --&gt; H<sub>2</sub>O<br /> H<sup>+</sup>+H<sup>+</sup> --&gt; H<sub>2</sub>O + <sup>-</sup>OH + H<sup>+</sup><br /> CHI<sub>3</sub> + C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH --&gt; C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>6</sub>I<sub>3</sub>OH<br />&nbsp;MY+CAT+ATE+MY+TEXTBOOK --&gt; H<sub>2</sub>O<br /> ...</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Write contradicting statements</h4>
<p>When you aren't sure which answer is right, write both down. For example,  	reflux at room temperature.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...Add HCN and KOH and HCl and Water and some cereal, then <em>reflux  		mixture in room temperature at standard states</em>...Add <em>ice</em> to decrease  		temperature to recrystalize. Distill <em>hot</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you write both, one is always right!</p>
<h4>Keyword shotgunning (bio only)</h4>
<p>When doing a <span class="strike">Biology</span>English exam, remember to always write  	in continuous prose, whether the work itself is junk or not.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The surface of the leaf, epithelium cell respires independently photophosphorylatively  		staged xml with my cat; and also vessel element nephron dihybrid cross enables  		the extension of mRNA PCR, whereas in...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Make sure you add linking words like "also" or "whereas" appropriately so  	the entire passage looks like some work. 	<a title="http://www.lipsum.com/" href="http://www.lipsum.com"> This site</a> covers this topic very thoroughly with interactive examples.</p>
<h4>When told to suggest ONE reason, always write more than one</h4>
<p>This one's tricky, because they only mark the first one. You'll have to answer  	like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Addition (Nucleophilic addition)<br /> Addition / "Electrophilic substitution"<br /> My cat - H<sub>2</sub>O<br /> Either CHI<sub>3</sub> or C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH, which are the same things<br /> My Cat, because of the H<sup>+</sup> in it<br /> H<sup>+</sup> is probable, so it should be OH<sup>-</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Experiment with different phrasing which allows you to put contradicting  	statements (see above).</p>
<h4>When stuck, draw random diagrams with tons of annotations</h4>
<p>they find the keywords in an unknown diagram in order to give you marks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>|------| &lt;--Dry ether (steric hindrance)<br /> |------| &lt;--Situ, complexes, ligand exchange, deprotonation<br /> |------| &lt;-- REFLUX!!!111</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Write down all math equations if you don't know which to use</h4>
<p>You'll always be awarded a mark for "suggesting an equation".</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Find acceleration.</em><br /> REFLUX A=V2/r, A=F/M, A=V/T, A=V/R, A=MCdT, CM = ACM, F=MA!!1</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Look at what others are doing</h4>
<p>This can help a lot. It includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>staring at the slanted exam paper in front of you between the armpit</li>
<li>looking for hand gestures which may arise when using left hand rule/right  		hand grip rule and you don't know which to use</li>
<li>glancing at "big-ass graphs" which others have drawn.</li>
<li>for labs, look at other people doing experiments. For some reason, it  		works better if you aren't doing it yourself.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Relax</h4>
<p>When all else fails, do random crap and hope for miracles. Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>continuous farting (no noise is needed, but can be fun to have)</li>
<li>uncontrolled burping, you might need a doctor's note for this</li>
<li>hiccups (practice. you must keep doing this when the invigilator comes  		over, as well as doing it after the cup of water is delivered to you)</li>
</ul>
