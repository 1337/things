The <em>Half the syllabus </em>incident - we found out 
during Forder&#39;s&nbsp;revision classes that Pritchard left out 
half of the syllabus last year and we didn&#39;t know what &quot;squamous&quot; 
&quot;cuboidal&quot; etc until AL. And to your surprise Pritchard 
likes to teach looking at the syllabus. So whenever he 
talks to us about the syllabus (pretty much every 
lesson) we&#39;ll say &quot;<em>half of it?</em>&quot; and secretly 
laugh for our own enjoyment. And yes, now we do read the 
syllabus ourselves just to double check.<br />
&quot;<em>To a certain extent</em>&quot; - the guy in SWIMS 
- and Pritchard - this 
is a politically correct method of answering 
all&nbsp;biological questions<br />
&quot;<em>More than one</em>&quot; - funnier variant of the one 
above. Now it&#39;s written on the board as spam like &quot;<em>&gt;1</em>&quot;</li>

Q: Is there a definite answer to TOK questions?<br />
