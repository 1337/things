    The physicsaurus is the mascot of the KGV Physics department. Its 
    history can be traced back to someone called &quot;Hanoch Wong&quot;, whoever he 
    is.</p>
    <p>
    As far as history can be traced back, this creature has been the second 
    longest running mascot for
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_George_V_School">the school</a> 
    (the first one being <strong>the lion</strong>, which is the school 
    mascot).</p>
    <p>It has become a celebration for KGV Physics alumni to post a 
    physicsaurus poster on the science notice board every year they return 
    for a visit.<sup>3</sup></p>
    <h3>Footnotes</h3>
    <ol>
    <li>Dark matter is very dense, but it doesn't matter.</li>
    <li>Cocoa beans and calculators are only consumed on Tuesdays.<br />
    Psychologists are not targets because psychology is not a science at 
    all.</li>
    <li>Well, we did our part... Physicsaurus returned to KGV in 2009.</li>
