<h3>7. lol</h3> <p>Descending from its original meaning of "laugh out loud", it no longer requires the sender to laugh out loud today. In 2010, 'lol' means practically nothing, simply acknowledges the receipt of messages. Sometimes, 'lol' can also mean 'tl;dr'.</p> <p>Unfortunately, there is a catch: 'lol' cannot follow a full stop ('lol.') because it will otherwise appear sarcastic. Hey, that's another use of 'lol'! lol!</p> <h3>6. =__=</h3> <p>Whoever invented the =__= face deserves a special prize - each of its astonishing number of variants has a slightly different meaning. For example:</p> <p><em>=___=   !=   -___- (flat face)</em></p> <p><em>-___-   !=   =.= (squinting)</em></p> <p><em>=.=   !=   ==' (sweating)</em></p> <p>and most interestingly,</p> <p><em>=___=   !=   =_=   !!</em></p> <p>What's more, the perception of meaning behind each of these faces differs from person to person, so you will never know what you will get - it's like a Kinder Surprise!</p> <h3>5. heh</h3> <p>Nobody will ever know what "heh" means. It is even more generic than "lol" because "heh" does not tell others whether or not you are laughing out loud. Win!</p> <h3>4. ic</h3> <p>You don't actually have to see.</p> <h3>3. :O</h3> <p>A face with an open mouth. What does that mean? It can mean everything! It shows false sense of concern for someone AND lets you pretend that you are interested in the conversation using just two characters!</p> <h3>Runner-up: ?</h3> <p>What do you think '?' means? Here are some choices I can think of: "what?" "pardon?" "eh?" "huh?" "tl;dr"</p> <p>? is an excellent ice-breaker. Just send your pals an IM, like this:</p> <p><em>Bob: ?</em></p> <p>And you will surely receive a reply - what a good conversation starter this is!</p> <p>Note: apparently, '???' has a different meaning from '?'.</p> <h3>Winner: ...</h3> <p>Ladies and gents, welcome our top IM choice of words!! Voted by 100% of my survey participants, '...' has meanings ranging from flowers to dinosaurs, from distrust, to awkwardness. If the conversation wasn't awkward, '...' promises to make it awkward for you. Wherever you use it, it always fits! Take a look at these examples:</p> <p><em>Bob: I got 90 for my exam lol</em><br /><em>Mary: ...</em></p> <p><em>Bob: I got 50 for my other exam lol</em><br /><em>Mary: ...</em></p> <p><em>Bob: Hey, wanna watch the new supermouse movie? </em><br /><em>Mary: ...</em></p> <p><em>Bob: I am breaking up with you.</em><br /><em>Mary: ...</em></p> <p>We highly recommend the use of '...' for all conversations, be it with your friends, colleagues or family. Feel free to also pass it on as your heirloom, and communicate with your offspring ...</p>
