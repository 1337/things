    <blockquote>
    Ian Paul Leatham, affectionately known as &quot;E&quot;, was born on the 16th 
    October 1955. (...) Ian and (his wife) Sue thought they might stay for 
    a couple of years, but it wasn't long before Xantha came along, followed shortly 
        by Ben. Nineteen years later.... Ian's family was his life, 
    he would spend every minute with Xantha and Ben whether it was playing 
    with them, helping with homework or taking them to one of their endless 
    extra curricular. Ian and Sue worked together in the same school and 
    they never tired of each others company. They loved their family holidays, 
    whether it was to somewhere exotic or just back to the UK. E loved his 
    BBQs and would happily sit under the up and over garage door at Croft, 
    invariably in the rain, enjoying his bottle of bud. (source: http://www.ianleatham.co.uk/)</blockquote>
    <p>With no doubt, he had influenced his Physics class of 2008, with one 
    of his many quotes that may change our point of view for everything, for 
    ever:</p>
    <blockquote>
    This (one mark) can be the difference between pass and fail.</blockquote>
    <p>We have that remembered. You will be succeeded by us, and of course,
