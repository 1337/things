    <h3>What is DoubleKey?</h3>
    <p>DoubleKey is a text input accelerator for Windows that helps instantly 
        complete your text.</p>

        &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/DTD/xhtml11.dtd&quot;&gt;</p>
    <p>DoubleKey aims to complete it by the time you finished typing &lt;!DO.</p>

        <li>If you hold &quot;D&quot; and press &quot;E&quot;, you can get &quot;deviantart.com&quot; (if you 
            want to).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It's that simple.</p>
