<h3>Before Leaving Campus</h3>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #888888;">As soon as you get a job for the upcoming work term, confirm  with your employer the start date, location, salary and to whom to  report.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #888888;">Start looking early for housing: UW Residences and Off-Campus Housing,          Lower Atrium, SLC has <a href="http://peanut.uwaterloo.ca/ochousing2/">off-campus</a> listings for not only accommodations in Kitchener-Waterloo, but out-of-town          locations frequented by UW co-op students. They also have an <a href="http://www.hrf.uwaterloo.ca/Student/Sublet/StIndex.htm">e-bulletin          board</a> to help you find someone with whom to share a place to live.          At the location of your work term, check college and university housing,          campus bulletin boards, and local newspapers/web sites. You could also          ask your field co-ordinator or your future employer for advice on where          to look. </span></li>
<li>Check that you have supplementary health insurance at the Cashiers Office in Needles Hall.</li>
<li><span style="color: #888888;">Check the public transportation office where you will be working to see if their student discount policy applies to you.</span></li>
<li>Obtain your field co-ordinator's business card from the Information Centre.</li>
<li><span style="color: #888888;">Be sure you have enough money for expenses until your first pay cheque (which might be a month or more after you start work).</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>Week 1 or 2</h3>
<p><span style="color: #888888;">During your first few weeks of employment, you are going to go  through orientation and probation. If you are not getting feedback from  your employer, ask for it. Take advantage of the feedback to learn how  you can improve your performance on the job.</span></p>
<p>After discussing your supervisor's expectations for the term, set  and write down achievable and measurable goals or objectives.&nbsp; See the  section on <a href="http://www.cecs.uwaterloo.ca/manual/learning_objectives.php">Learning Objectives</a> in this publication for more information.</p>

</ul>
<h3>Week 4</h3>
<p>Discuss your <a href="http://www.cecs.uwaterloo.ca/manual/work_reports.php">work        report</a> with your supervisor.&nbsp; If your work assignment does not        lend itself to a related topic for a work report you should decide on your        own topic.&nbsp; Your field co-ordinator could provide you with some advice        on subjects if required. When producing a work report not assigned by your        supervisor, check with them in advance to determine if any time might be        available to you on the job to prepare it. (Be familiar with the work report        guidelines for your program). Check with your faculty if it appears that        your report will be confidential. It may not be acceptable.</p>
<p>If your employer has not already set a date, make an appointment  to discuss your evaluation and your objectives.&nbsp; If you feel you would  like your own copy of the completed evaluation, arrange with your  supervisor to supply you with a photocopy at this time.</p>
<h4>&sect; <a id="Work_Site_Visit" name="Work_Site_Visit"></a>The Field Co-ordinator Work Site Visit (<a href="http://www.cecs.uwaterloo.ca/manual/work_term/8_3.php">full details</a>)</h4>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Help? </strong><br /> If you have questions or problems prior to or after your field  co-ordinator visit, do not hesitate to telephone CECS at 888-4026.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Week 5</h3>
<p>Review your objectives and rewrite them if necessary to reflect changes in expectations or circumstances.</p>
<h3>Week 9</h3>
<ul>
<li>Encourage your supervisor to review the Employer's Evaluation  form that grades your performance for the term and discuss any areas of  concern he/she may have about your work to date.&nbsp; This will help you to  know where you stand and will give you an opportunity to improve in  areas that you may be weak in. </li>
<li>Discuss the two work term opportunity with your supervisor;  returning gives you a shorter learning curve, increased knowledge, more  training, and more responsibility; it reduces recruiting and training  costs and creates higher student productivity for the employer.</li>
<li>Find out what makes a job worth returning to; network with  other students, staff, and managers; learn about other departments; talk  to your supervisor about available opportunities, the company's needs,  and your interests.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Week 13</h3>
<ul>
<li>Complete the first draft of your work report.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Confirm with your supervisor your availability for a second  work term.&nbsp; You are expected to return if you are invited back by your  employer.Remember, if you were advised earlier via the job description  or during your interview that the employer required you to return to  return for a second term, you have an obligation to fulfill (assuming  that the employer has a job for you). &nbsp;This decision is not normally  made by the supervisor, but rather by the person who is the company's  contact with the university, e.g., human resources. &nbsp;If you will be  returning you should discuss the following things before you leave:           
<ul>
<li>salary </li>
<li>position you will have when you return </li>
<li>who you will be working for </li>
<li>when you will report </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Week 15</h3>
<ul>
<li>Confirm the final working day with your employer.</li>
<li>Complete your work report. Students in Mathematics must  present their work reports to their employers for technical evaluation  as well as to the university for a final evaluation.&nbsp; Students in  Applied Health Sciences must present their work reports to their  employers for evaluation as well as a copy to the university. </li>
<li>Leave an address or means by which the employer may contact you during the school term. </li>
<li>If you will be going through interviews next term, revise your  r&eacute;sum&eacute; to reflect the experience gained on this work term. &nbsp;Arrange to  have the r&eacute;sum&eacute; updated and loaded onto <em>JobMine </em> before you return to campus (if you do plan to go through interviews). &nbsp; </li>
</ul>
<h3>Return-to-Campus</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.cecs.uwaterloo.ca/students/rtc.php">Check for date/time          of interview</a> before the first day of classes.</li>
<li>Confirm status for next work term.</li>
<li>Confirm that a student performance evaluation form was completed and          received by CECS.</li>
<li>Confirm work report due date.</li>
<li>Sign up <a href="http://www.cecs.uwaterloo.ca/students/rtc.php">online</a> before the first day of classes for your return-to-campus interview with          your field co-ordinator if they are expecting to meet with you. The online          schedule is usually available one week prior to the first week of lectures.          &nbsp;Your interview will be scheduled to take place during the first          week of classes. &nbsp;It is crucial that you make your intentions known          to the CECS at this meeting as to what you will be doing for the next          work term. &nbsp;An interview with your field co-ordinator MUST take place          if you expect to take part in the job application process. </li>
<li>Send a letter or memo of thanks to the appropriate person (be sure to          send a copy to the people in human resources for your file) and confirm          all arrangements for the next work term if you are returning.</li>
