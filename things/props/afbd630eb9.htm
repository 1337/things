<p>Here is an image of which buildings in Waterloo are connected together. There are roughly five groups.</p>
<p><img style="margin: auto; display: block;" src="photos/tnb.jpg" alt="Waterloo's tunnels and bridges" /></p>
<h3>Notable mentions</h3>
<ul>
<li>E2 wins "the most number of connections", with 5 bridges, tunnels or nearby buildings to PHY (3rd floor bridge), RCH (Underground bridge), E3, CPH and DWE (I think).</li>
<li>E3 gets runner-up with bridges to E5, DC, EIT and E2.</li>
<li>ML, AL, TC, SCH and HH are connected by an underground tunnel.</li>
<li>You suddenly realise that all science/math/engineering buildings are connected, and all arts buildings are connected (at least for now).</li>
</ul>
