<pre>
I am not a big fan of bombs, phreaking (that is so the 1990s) and stupid termin-
al hacking (honeypots, I see you). Upon receipt of the "ANARCHY COOKBOOK VERSIO-
N 2000" book, I immediately conceived the book as a compilation of expired work-
s from the last decade. Of course, we are all grown-ups now, so I decided to re-
tain only chemical equivalency, preparation, and synthesis.

This document does not teach you how to make bombs. It only teaches you how to 
make chemicals.

Credits to "The Jolly Roger" and "The Exodus" et al., whose names have appeared 
countless times in the original book. Since this document is reorgnised and cor-
rected with more facual content, their names will no longer appear next to list 
items. I assume these forewriters have all died from making bombs.
                                        
                                Safety First
-   Don't smoke!
-   Don't inhale fumes! Work in a fume cupboard.
-   Wear Lab Gloves and Goggles! - note that some organic compounds can go thro-
    ugh gloves.
-   Grind All Ingredients Separately. - things can explode on friction.
-   Pour carefully. Avoid splattering when dealing with liquids.
-   Expect Errors - allow 20% material difference, especially when working with 
    impure chemicals.
-   Avoid Electricity.


                        How to Mix Ingredients
Use:
-   1 large sheet of smooth paper (e.g. newspaper)
-   The dry chemicals needed for the desired compound.

Procedures:
-   Measure out the appropriate amounts of the two chemicals, and pour them in 
    two small heaps near opposite corners of the sheet.
-   Pick up the sheet by the two corners near the powders, allowing the powders 
    to roll towards the middle of the sheet.
-   By raising one corner and then the other, roll the powders back and forth in
    the middle of the open sheet, taking care not to let the mixture spill from 
    either of the loose ends.
-   Pour the powder off from the middle of the sheet, and use immediately. If it
    must be stored use airtight containers (35mm film canisters work nicely) and
    store away from people, houses, and valuable items.

                        How to make Potassium Nitrate
Reagents:
-   3Â½ gallons of nitrate bearing earth or other material
-   Â½ cup of wood ashes
-   Bucket or other similar container about 4-5 gallons in volume
-   2 pieces of finely woven cloth, each a bit bigger than the bottom of the bu-
    cket
-   Shallow dish or pan at least as large in diameter as the bucket
-   Shallow, heat resistant container
-   2 gallons of water
-   Something to punch holes in the bottom of the bucket
-   1 gallon of any type of alcohol
-   A heat source
-   Paper & tape

Procedures:
-   Punch holes on the inside bottom of the bucket, so that the metal is
"puckered" outward from the bottom.
-   Spread cloth over the holes from the bottom.
-   Place wood ashes on the cloth. Spread it out so that it covers the entire 
    cloth and has about the same thickness.
-   Place 2nd cloth on top of the wood ashes.
-   Place the dirt or other material in the bucket.
-   Place the bucket over the shallow container. NOTE: It may need support on 
    the bottom so that the holes on the bottom are not blocked.
-   Boil water and pour it over the earth very slowly. Do NOT pour it all at on-
    ce, as this will clog the filter on the bottom.
-   Allow water to run through holes into the shallow dish on the bottom.
-   Be sure that the water goes through ALL of the earth!
-   Allow water in dish to cool for an hour or so.
-   Carefully drain the liquid in the dish away, and discard the sludge in the 
    bottom.
-   Boil this liquid over a fire for at least two hours. Small grains of salt w-
    ill form - scoop these out with the paper as they form.
-   When the liquid has boiled down to Â½ its original volume let it sit.
-   After Â½ hour, add equal volume of the alcohol; when this mixture is poured 
    through paper, small white crystals appear. This is the potassium nitrate.

Purification:
-   Redissolve crystals in small amount of boiling water.
-   Remove any crystals that appear.
-   Pour through improvised filter then heat concentrated solution to dryness.
-   Spread out crystals and allow to dry.




                                Nitric Acid
Reagents:
-   Potassium Nitrate (2 parts by volume)
-   CONCENTRATED sulfuric acid (1 part by volume)

Procedure:
-   Place dry potassium nitrate in bottle or jug.
-   Add sulfuric acid. Do not fill the bottle more than 25% full. Mix until pas-
    te is formed.
    DO NOT INHALE FUMES!
-   Wrap paper or rags around necks of two bottles. securely tape necks of two 
    bottles together. Be sure that bottles are flush against each other and that
    there are no air spaces.
-   Support bottles on rocks or cans so that empty bottle is SLIGHTLY lower than
    bottle containing paste so that nitric acid that is formed in receiving bot-
    tle will not run into other bottle.
-   Build fire in pot or frying pan.
-   Gently heat bottle containing mixture by gently moving fire in and out.
    As red fumes begin to appear periodically pour cool water over empty receiv-
    ing bottle. Nitric acid will begin to form in receiving bottle.
    CAUTION: Do not overheat or wet bottle containing mixture or it may shatter.
    As an added precaution, place bottle in heat resistant container filled with
    sand or gravel. Heat this outer container to produce nitric acid.
-   Continue the above process until no more red fumes are formed.
    If the nitric acid formed in the receiving bottle is not clear (cloudy),
    pour it into cleaned bottle and repeat steps 2-6.
-   CAUTION: Nitric acid should be kept away from all combustibles and should be
    kept in a SEALED CERAMIC OR GLASS container. DO NOT inhale fumes!




                        Nitroglycerin Recipe (Dangerous)
Instructions:
-   Fill a 75-milliliter beaker to the 13 mL. Level with fuming red nitric acid,
    of 98% pure concentration.
-   Place the beaker in an ice bath and allow to cool below room temp.
-   After it has cooled, add to it three times the amount of fuming sulfuric ac-
    id (99% h2so4).  In other words, add to the now-cool fuming nitric acid 39mL
    of fuming sulfuric acid.
-   When the two are mixed, lower their temp. By adding more ice to the bath, a-
    bout 10-15Â°C. (Use a mercury-operated thermometer)
-   When the acid solution has cooled to the desired temperature, it is ready f-
    or the glycerin. The glycerin must be added in small amounts using a medici-
    ne dropper. (Read this step about 10 times!) Glycerin is added slowly and c-
    arefully (I mean careful!) Until the entire surface of the acid it covered 
    with it.
-   This is a dangerous point since the nitration will take place as soon as the
    glycerin is added. The nitration will produce heat, so the solution must be 
    kept below 30Â°C! If the solution should go above 30Â°C, immediately dump the 
    solution into the ice bath!  This will insure that it does not go off in yo-
    ur face!
-   For the first ten minutes of nitration, the mixture should be gently stirre-
    d.  In a normal reaction the nitroglycerin will form as a layer on top of t-
    he acid solution, while the sulferic acid will absorb the excess water.
-   After the nitration has taken place, and the nitroglycerin has formed on th-
    e top of the solution, the entire beaker should be transferred slowly and c-
    arefully to another beaker of water. When this is done the nitroglycerin wi-
    ll settle at the bottom so the other acids can be drained away.
-   After removing as much acid as possible without disturbing the nitroglyceri-
    n, remove the nitroglycerin with an eyedropper and place it in a bicarbonat-
    e of soda (sodium bicarbonate in case you didn't know) solution.  The sodium
    is an alkali and will neutralize much of the acid remaining. This process s-
    hould be repeated as much as necessary using blue litmus paper to check for 
    the presence of acid.  The remaining acid only makes the nitroglycerin more 
    unstable than it already is.
-   Finally! The final step is to remove the nitroglycerin from the bicarbonate.
    This is done with an eye-dropper, slowly and carefully. The usual test to s-
    ee if nitration has been successful is to place one drop of the nitroglycer-
    in on metal and ignite it.  If it is true nitroglycerin it will burn with a 
    clear blue flame.

** Caution **
Nitro is very sensitive to decomposition, heating dropping, or jarring, and may 
explode if left undisturbed and cool.




                            Potassium Chlorate

Heat bleach. Add potassium chloride. Cool the solution, and filter it.
Product is a mixture of Potassium chlorate and NaCl.




                Making Plastic Explosives from Bleach (Dangerous)

Reagents:
-   A heat source (hot plate, stove, etc.)
-   A hydrometer, or battery hydrometer
-   Bleach, a gallon
-   A large Pyrex, or enameled steel container (to weigh chemicals)
-   Potassium chloride

Procedures:
-   Heat bleach in container. While this solution heats, add 63g of potassium c-
    hloride. Constantly check the solution being heated with the hydrometer, an-
    d boil until you get a reading of 1.3. If using a battery hydrometer, boil 
    until you read a FULL charge.
-   Take the solution and allow it to cool in a refrigerator until it is between
    room temperature and 0Â°C. Filter out the crystals that have formed and save 
    them. Boil this solution again and cool as before. Filter and save the crys-
    tals.
-   Take the crystals that have been saved, and mix them with distilled water in
    the following proportions: 56 grams per 100 milliliters distilled water. He-
    at this solution until it boils and allow to cool. Filter the solution and 
    save the crystals that form upon cooling. This process of purification is c-
    alled "fractional crystallization". These crystals should be relatively pure
    potassium chlorate.
-   Powder these to the consistency of face powder, and heat gently to drive off
    all moisture.
-   Now, melt five parts Vaseline with five parts wax. Dissolve this in white g-
    asoline (camp stove gasoline), and pour this liquid on 90 parts potassium c-
    hlorate (the powdered crystals from above) into a plastic bowl. Knead this 
    liquid into the potassium chlorate until intimately mixed. Allow all gasoli-
    ne to evaporate.
-   Finally, place this explosive into a cool, dry place. Avoid friction, sulfu-
    r, sulfides, and phosphorous compounds. This explosive is best molded to the
    desired shape and density of 1.3 grams in a cube and dipped in wax until wa-
    ter proof. These block type charges guarantee the highest detonation veloci-
    ty. Also, a blasting cap of at least a 3 grade must be used.
-   The presence of the aforementioned compounds (sulfur, sulfides, etc.) resul-
    ts in mixtures that are or can become highly sensitive and will possibly de-
    compose explosively while in storage. You should never store homemade explo-
    sives, and you must use EXTREME caution at all times while performing the p-
    rocesses in this article.




                            Solidox (Dangerous)

-   Grind solidox and sugar separately.
-   Mix sugar with the Solidox in 1:1 (weight ratio).




                             Thermite (Dangerous)

-   Crush some rust into a fine powder and heat it in a cast-iron pot until it 
    is red. Now mix the pure iron oxide with pure aluminum filings which can be 
    bought or filed down by hand from an aluminum tube or bar. The ratio or iron
    oxide to aluminum is 8 grams to 3 grams. This is thermite.
-   Thermite requires a LOT of heat (more than a blow torch!) to ignite. Howeve-
    r, magnesium ribbons will do the trick.  It takes the heat from the burning 
    magnesium to light the thermite.
-   Ignite magnesium strip with blow torch. Strip will ignite thermite.




                              Touch Explosives

-   Mix iodine crystals into ammonia until the iodine crystals will not dissolve
    into the ammonia anymore. Pour off the excess ammonia and dry out the cryst-
    als on a baking sheet the same way as you dried the thermite (in other words
    just let it sit overnight!).
-   Be careful now because these crystals are now your touch explosive. Careful-
    ly (it blows on friction) wrap a bunch in paper and throw them around.




                                 Smoke Bombs

Reagents:
-   4 parts sugar
-   6 parts potassium nitrate (Salt Peter)

Heat this mixture over a LOW flame until it melts, stirring well. Pour it into a
future container and, before it solidifies, imbed a few matches into the mixture
to use as fuses. One pound of this will fill up a whole block with smoke!




                               Mail Box Bombs

-   Two liter bottle of chlorine (must contain sodium hypochlorate)
-   Small amount of sugar
-   Small amount of water

Mix all three of these in equal amounts to fill about 1/10 of the bottle. Screw 
on the lid and place in a mailbox.




                                  Cyanides

Here are ways of making poisons:
    Cyanide
    -   2Ba + O2 ==> 2BaO
    -   BaO + 3C + N2 ==> Ba(CN)2 + CO
    Cyanide
    -   K4[Fe(CN)6]3 + conc H2SO4, then add conc NaOH. stir and heat. 
    -   Gas is poisonous and so is the solution.




                            .......Napalm

-   Pour gasoline into a container.
-   Put styrofoam in the gas, until the gas won't eat anymore. You should have a
    sticky syrup.
-   Put it on the end of something (don't touch it!!). The unused stuff lasts a 
    long time!

Napalms is simply one part gasoline and one part (shredded) bar soap. 
The gasoline must be heated in a double boiler order for the soap to melt.
The water in the bottom part is brought to a boil and the double boiler is taken
from the stove and carried to where there is no flame. Then one part, by volume,
of gasoline is put in the top part and allowed to heat as much as it will and t-
he soap is added and the mess is stirred until it thickens. A better way to heat
gasoline is to fill a bathtub with water as hot as you can get it. It will hold 
its heat longer and permit a much larger container than will the double boiler.





                    . Calcium Carbide Bomb (Dangerous)

-   Obtain some calcium carbide.
-   Put it in a glass jar with some water. Put a lid on tightly.

The carbide will react with the water to produce acetylene carbonate, which is 
similar to the gas used in cutting torches. Eventually the glass with explode 
from internal pressure.




                     How to Make Dynamite (Dangerous)

Dynamite is nitroglycerin and a stabilizing agent to make it much safer to use.
The amounts are weight percentages.

    Nitroglycerin           47%
    Starch                  50%
    Guncotton               3%


                          Generic Bomb (Dangerous)

-   Acquire a glass / plastic container with cap.
-   Put in a few drops of gasoline.
-   Cap the top. wait for the gasoline to evaporate.
-   Add a few drops of potassium permanganate

The bomb is detonated by throwing against a solid object.





                              Match Head Bomb

Collect enough match heads, then light them up in a bucket, bottle, etc.




                            Unstable Explosives

Mix solid Nitric Iodine with household ammonia. Wait overnight and then pour off
the liquid. You will be left with a muddy substance. Dry till it hardens.  Now 
throw it at something!!!!



                               Sodium Chlorate

Sodium Chlorate is an oxidizer - can be used in place of Potassium Chlorate.
Instructions require a vehicle.

Reagents:
-   Salt, or ocean water
-   Sulfuric acid, diluted
-   Water
-   Gasoline

Instructions:
-   Mix Â½ cup of salt into the one gallon glass jar with 3L of water.
-   Add 2 teaspoons of battery acid and stir vigorously for 5 minutes.
-   Strip about 4 inches of insulation from both ends of the two wires.
-   With knife and sticks, shape 2 strips of wood 1 by 1/8 by 1-Â½. Tie the wood 
    strips to the lead or carbon rods so that they are 1-Â½ inches apart.
-   Connect the rods to the battery in a motor vehicle with the insulated wire.
-   Submerge 4-Â½ inches of the rods in the salt water solution.
-   With gear in neutral position, start the vehicle engine. Depress the accele-
    rator approx. 1/5 of its full travel.
-   Run the engine with the accelerator in this position for 2 hours, then shut 
    it down for 2 hours.
-   Repeat this cycle for a total of 64 hours while maintaining the level of the
    acid-salt water solution in the glass jar.

    CAUTION: This arrangement employs voltages which can be quite dangerous!
    Do not touch bare wire leads while engine is running!!

-   Shut off the engine. Remove the rods from the glass jar and disconnect wire 
    leads from the battery.
-   Filter the solution through the heavy cloth into a flat pan or tray, leaving
    the sediment at the bottom of the glass jar.
-   Allow the water in the filtered solution to evaporate at room temperature 
    (approx. 16 hours). The residue is approximately 60% or more sodium chlorate
    which is pure enough to be used as an explosive ingredient.




                              Mercury Fulminate

Mercury Fulminate is used as a primary explosive in detonators. It is to be used
with a booster explosive such as picric acid or RDX.

Reagents:
-   Nitric Acid, 90% conc. (1.48 sp. gr)
-   Mercury
-   Ethyl (grain) alcohol (90%)
-   Filtering material [Paper Towels]
-   Teaspoon measure (Â¼, Â½, and 1 tsp. capacity)
-   aluminum, stainless steel or wax coated
-   Clean water

Instructions:
-   Dilute 5 teaspoons of nitric acid with 2-Â½ teaspoons of clean water in a gl-
    ass container by adding the acid to the water.
-   Dissolve 1/8 teaspoon of mercury in the diluted nitric acid. This will yiel-
    d dark red fumes. NOTE: It may be necessary to add water, on drop at a time,
    to the mercury-acid solution in order to start a reaction.

    CAUTION: Acid will burn skin and destroy clothing. If any is spilled, wash 
    it away with a large quantity of water. Do NOT inhale fumes!

-   Warm 10 teaspoons of the alcohol in a container until the alcohol feels warm
    to the inside of the wrist.
-   Pour the metal-acid solution into the warm alcohol. Reaction should start in
    less than 5 minutes. White fumes will be given off during the reaction. As 
    time lapses, the fumes will become less dense. Allow 10 to 15 minutes to co-
    mplete reaction. Fulminate will settle to the bottom.
    
    CAUTION: This reaction generates large quantities of toxic, flammable fumes.
    The process MUST be conducted outdoors or in a well-ventilated area, away f-
    rom sparks or open flames. DO NOT inhale fumes!

-   Filter the solution through a paper towel into a container. Crystals may st-
    ick to the side of the container. If so, tilt and squirt water down the sid-
    es of the container until all of the material collects on the filter paper.
-   Wash the crystals with 6 teaspoons of ethyl alcohol.
-   Allow these mercury fulminate crystals to air dry.

    CAUTION: Handle dry explosive with great care. Do not scrape or handle it 
    roughly! Keep away from sparks or open flames. Store in a cool, dry place.




                          Improvised Black Powder

Black powder may be used as blasting or gun powder.

Reagents:
-   Potassium Nitrate, granulated, 3 cups (3/4 liter)
-   Wood charcoal, powdered, 2 cups
-   Sulfur, powdered, Â½ cup
-   Alcohol, 5 pints (2-Â½ liters) (whiskey, rubbing alcohol, etc.)
-   Water, 3 cups (3/4 liter)

Instructions:
-   Place alcohol in one of the buckets.
-   Place potassium nitrate, charcoal, and sulfur in the heat resistant bucket. 
    Add 1 cup water and mix thoroughly with wooden stick until all ingredients 
    are dissolved.
-   Add remaining water (2 cups) to mixture. Place bucket on heat source and st-
    ir until small bubbles begin to form.

    CAUTION: DO NOT boil mixture. Be sure ALL mixture stays wet. If any is dry, 
    as on sides of pan, it may ignite!

-   Remove bucket from heat and pour mixture into alcohol while stirring vigoro-
    usly.
-   Let alcohol mixture stand about 5 minutes. Strain mixture through cloth to 
    obtain black powder. Discard liquid. Wrap cloth around black powder and squ-
    eeze to remove all excess liquid.
-   Place screening over dry bucket. Place workable amount of damp powder on sc-
    reen and granulate by rubbing solid through screen. NOTE: If granulated par-
    ticles appear to stick together and change shape, recombine entire batch of 
    powder and repeat steps 5 & 6.
-   Spread granulated black powder on flat, dry surface so that layer about Â½ i-
    nch (1-Â¼ cm) is formed. Allow to dry. Use radiator, or direct sunlight. This
    should be dried as soon as possible, preferably in an hour. The longer the 
    drying period, the less effective the black powder.

    CAUTION: Remove from heat AS SOON AS granules are dry.
    
Black powder is now ready to use.



                            Carbon-Tet Explosive

A moist explosive mixture can be made from fine aluminum powder combined with c-
arbon tetrachloride or tetrachloroethylene. This explosive can be detonated with
a blasting cap.

Reagents:
-   Fine aluminum bronzing powder
-   Carbon Tetrachloride or Tetrachloroethylene

Instructions:
-   Measure out two parts aluminum powder to one part carbon tetrachloride or 
    tetrachlorethylene liquid into mixing container, adding liquid to powder wh-
    ile stirring with the wooden rod.
-   Stir until the mixture becomes the consistency of honey syrup.

    CAUTION: Fumes from the liquid are dangerous and should not be inhaled.

-   Store explosive in a jar or similar water proof container until ready to us-
    e. The liquid in the mixture evaporates quickly when not confined.

    NOTE: Mixture will detonate in this manner for a period of 72 hours.

How to Use:
-   Pour this mixture into an iron or steel pipe which has an end cap threaded 
    on one end. If a pipe is not available, you may use a dry tin can.
-   Insert blasting cap just beneath the surface of the explosive mix.

    NOTE: Confining the open end of the container will add to the effectiveness 
    of the explosive.




                       Making Picric Acid from Aspirin                          

Picric Acid can be used as a booster explosive in detonators, a high explosive 
charge, or as an intermediate to preparing lead picric.

Reagents:
-   Aspirin tablets (5 grains per tablet)
-   Alcohol, 95% pure
-   Sulfuric acid, concentrated, (if battery acid, boil until white fumes)
-   Potassium Nitrate (see elsewhere in this Cookbook)

Procedure:
-   Crush 20 aspirin tablets in a glass container. Add 1 teaspoon of water and 
    work into a paste.
-   Add approximately 1/3 to Â½ cup of alcohol (100 milliliters) to the aspirin 
    paste; stir while pouring.
-   Filter the alcohol-aspirin solution through a paper towel into another glass
    container. Discard the solid left in the paper towel.
-   Pour the filtered solution into a glass or ceramic dish.
-   Evaporate the alcohol and water from the solution by placing the dish into a
    pan of hot water. White powder will remain in the dish after evaporation.

    NOTE: The water in the pan should be at hot bath temperature, not boiling, 
    approx 160Â°F to 180Â°F. It should not burn the hands.

-   Pour 1/3 cup (80 milliliters) of concentrated sulfuric acid into a canning 
    jar. Add the white powder to the sulfuric acid.
-   Heat canning jar of sulfuric acid in a pan of simmering hot water bath for 
    15 minutes; then remove jar from the bath. Solution will turn to a yellow-
    orange color.
-   Add 3 level teaspoons (15 grams) of potassium nitrate in three portions to 
    the yellow-orange solution; stir vigorously during additions. Solution will 
    turn red, then back to a yellow-orange color.
-   Allow the solution to cool to ambient room temperature while stirring occas-
    ionally.
-   Slowly pour the solution, while stirring, into 1-Â¼ cup (300 milliliters) of
    cold water and allow to cool.
-   Filter the solution through a paper towel into a glass container. Light yel-
    low particles will collect on the paper towel.
-   Wash the light yellow particles with 2 tablespoons (25mL) of water. Discard 
    the waste liquid in the container.
-   Place articles in ceramic dish and set in a hot water bath, as in step 5, f-
    or 2 hours.




                    Reclamation of RDX from C-4 Explosives                   

RDX can be obtained from C-4 explosives with the use of gasoline. It can be used
as a booster explosive for detonators or as a high explosive charge.

Reagents:
-   Gasoline
-   C-4 explosive

Procedure:
-   Place 1-Â½ tsp (15g) of C-4 explosive in one of the pint jars. Add 1 cup (240
    mL) of gasoline.

    NOTE: These quantities can be increased to obtain more RDX. For example, use
    2 gallons of gasoline per 1 cup of C-4.

-   Knead and stir the C-4 with the rod until the C-4 has broken down into small
    particles. Allow mixture to stand for Â½ hour.
-   Stir the mixture again until a fine white powder remains on the bottom of t-
    he jar.
-   Filter the mixture through a paper towel into the other glass jar. Wash the 
    particles collected on the paper towel with Â½ cup (120 milliliters) of gaso-
    line. Discard the waste liquid.
-   Place the RDX particles in a glass or ceramic dish. Set the dish in a pan of
    hot water, not boiling and dry for a period of 1 hour.

    NOTE: The RDX particles may be air dried for a period of 2 to 3 hours.

fuels! NO SMOKING!!

-   Separate the egg white from the yolk. This can be done by breaking the egg 
    into a dish and carefully removing the yolk with a spoon.
-   Pour egg white into a jar, bottle, or other container, and add gasoline.
-   Add the salt (or other additive) to the mixture and stir occasionally until 
    gel forms (about 5 to 10 minutes).

    NOTE: A thicker gelled flame fuel can be obtained by putting the capped jar 
    in hot (65Â°C) water for about Â½ hour and then letting them cool to room tem-
    perature. (DO NOT HEAT THE GELLED FUEL CONTAINING COFFEE!!)




                                 Nicotine

Nicotine is an abundant poison. A few drops can kill someone.
Get a can of chewing tobacco. Soak in water overnight in a jar (about 2/3 cup of
water will do...). In the morning, strain into another jar the mixture through a
porous towel. Then wrap the towel around the ball of tobacco and squeeze it unt-
il all of the liquid is in the jar. Throw away the tobacco--you will not need it
anymore.

Allow to evaporate until a sticky syrup results. This is almost pure nicotine.





                                    LSD

-   Grind up 150 grams of Morning Glory seeds or baby Hawaiian wood rose seeds.
-   In 130 cc. of petroleum ether, soak the seeds for two days.
-   Filter the solution through a tight screen.
-   Throw away the liquid, and allow the seed mush to dry.
-   For two days  allow the mush to soak in 110 cc. of wood alcohol.
-   Filter the solution again, saving the liquid and labeling it "1."
-   Resoak the mush in 110 cc. of  wood alcohol for two days.
-   Filter and throw away the mush.
-   Add the liquid from the second soak to the solution labeled "1."
-   Pour the liquid into a cookie tray and allow it to evaporate.
-   When all of  the liquid has evaporated, a yellow gum remains. This should be
    scraped up and put into capsules.
    
-   30 grams of Morning Glory seeds = 1 trip
-   15 Hawaiian wood rose seeds = 1 trip

Many companies, such as Northop-King, have been coating their seeds with a toxic
chemical, which is poison. Order seeds from a wholesaler, as it is much safer a-
nd cheaper.



                     Bananas (Musa Sapientum Bananadine)

MSB is a mild, short-lasting psychedelic. It is legal.

-   Obtain 15 lbs. of ripe yellow bananas.
-   Peel all 15 lbs. and eat the fruit. Save the peels.
-   With a sharp knife, scrape off the insides of the peels and save the scraped
    material.
-   Put all of the scraped material in a large pot and add water. Boil for three
    to four hours until it has attained a solid paste consistency.
-   Spread this paste on cookie sheets, and dry in an over for about 20 minutes 
    to a half hour. This will result in a fine black powder. Makes about one po-
    und of bananadine powder. Usually one will feel the effects of bananadine a-
    fter smoking three or four cigarettes.



                            Chemical Fire Bottle

This incendiary bottle is self-igniting on target impact.

Materials Required
-  CONCENTRATED Sulphuric Acid (boiled until white fumes given off)
-  Gasoline
-  Potassium Chlorate
-  Sugar
-   Glass bottle with stopper (roughly 1 quart size)
-   Small Bottle or jar with lid.
-   Rag or absorbent paper (paper towels, newspaper)
-   String or rubber bands


CAUTION: Sulphuric Acid will burn skin and destroy clothing. If any is spilled, 
    wash it away with a large quantity of water. Fumes are also VERY dangerous 
    and should not be inhaled.

Instructions:
-   Remove the acid from heat and allow to cool to room temperature.
-   Pour gasoline into the large 1 quart bottle until it is approximately 1/3 f-
    ull.
-   Add concentrated sulphuric acid to gasoline slowly until the bottle is fill-
    ed to within 1" to 2" from top. Place the stopper on the bottle.
-   Wash the outside of the bottle thoroughly with clear water.

    CAUTION: If this is not done, the fire bottle may be dangerous to handle du-
    ring use!

-   Wrap a clean cloth or several sheets of absorbent paper around the outside 
    of the bottle. Tie with string or fasten with rubber bands.
-   Dissolve Â½ cup (100 grams) of potassium chlorate and Â½ cup (100 grams) of s-
    ugar in one cup (250 cc) of boiling water.
-   Allow the solution to cool, pour into the small bottle and cap tightly. The 
    cooled solution should be approx. 2/3 crystals and 1/3 liquid. If there is 
    more than this, pour off excess before using.

CAUTION: Store this bottle separately from the  other bottle!

How To Use:
-   Shake the small bottle to mix contents and pour onto the cloth or paper aro-
    und the large bottle. Bottle can be used wet or after solution is dried. Ho-
    wever, when dry, the sugar-Potassium chlorate mixture is very sensitive to 
    spark or flame and should be handled accordingly.
-   Throw or launch the bottle. When the bottle breaks against a hard surface 
    (target) the fuel will ignite.




                      "Red or White Powder" Propellant

"Red or White Powder" Propellant may be prepared in a simple, safe manner. The
formulation described below will result in approximately 2 Â½ pounds of powder. 
This is a small arms propellant and should only be used in weapons  with Â½ in. 
diameter or less (but not pistols!).

Reagents:
-   Potassium Nitrate (granulated) 2-1/3 cups
-   White sugar (granulated) 2 cups
-   Powdered ferric oxide (rust) 1/8 cup (if available)
-   Clear water, 1-Â½ cups

Instructions:
-   Place the sugar, potassium nitrate, and water in the bucket. Heat with a low
    flame, stirring occasionally until the sugar and potassium nitrate dissolve.
-   If available, add the ferric oxide (rust) to the solution. Increase the fla-
    me under the mixture until it boils gently.

    NOTE: The mixture will retain the rust coloration.

-   Stir and scrape the bucket sides occasionally until the mixture is reduced 
    to one quarter of its original volume, then stir continuously.
-   As the water evaporates, the mixture will become thicker until it reaches t-
    he consistency of cooked breakfast cereal or homemade fudge. At this stage 
    of thickness, remove the bucket from the heat source, and spread the mass on
    the metal sheet.
-   While the material cools, score it with a spoon or spatula in crisscrossed 
    furrows about 1 inch apart.
-   Allow the material to dry, preferably in the sun. As it dries, restore it a-
    ccordingly (about every 20 minutes) to aid drying.
-   When the material has dried to a point where it is moist and soft but not s-
    ticky to the touch, place a small spoonful on the screen. Rub the material 
    back and forth against the screen mesh with spoon or other flat object until
    the material is granulated into small worm-like particles.
-   After granulation, return the material to the sun to dry completely.

                           Liquid Nitrogen Bomb

Materials:
-   1 Plastic Two Liter Bottle
-   Enough Liquid Nitrogen To Fill The Bottle

Instructions:
-   Fill the bottle with liquid nitrogen.
-   Cap as tightly as possible. 

The vaporization of the nitrogen will create enough pressure in the bottle 
(within 5-15 minutes) to break it with a quite strong explosive force.




                              TNT (Dangerous)

A mixture of 294 grams of concentrated sulfuric acid (density 1.84) and 147 gra-
ms of nitric acid (density 1.42) is added slowly from a dropping funnel to 100
grams of toluene in a tall 600mL beaker, while the liquid is stirred vigorously 
with an electric stirrer and it's temperature is maintained at 30 to 40 degrees 
celsius by running cold water in the vessel in which the beaker is standing. The
addition of acid will require from an hour to an hour and a half. The stirring 
is then continued for half an hour longer without cooling; the mixture is allow-
ed to stand over night in a separatory funnel; the lower layer of spent acid is 
drawn off; and the crude mononitrotoluene is weighed. One-half of it, correspon-
ding to 50 grams of toluene, is taken for the dinitration.

The MNT is dissolved in 109 grams of concentrated sulfuric acid (d. 1.84) while 
the mixture is cooled in running water.

The solution in a tall beaker is warmed to 50 degrees and a mixed acid, composed
of 54.5 grams each of nitric acid (d. 1.50) and sulfuric acid (d. 1.84), is add-
ed slowly drop by drop from a dropping funnel while the mixture is stirred mech-
anically. The heat generated by the reaction raises the temperature, and the ra-
te of addition of the acid is regulated so that the temperature of the mixture 
lies always between 90 degrees and 100 degrees. The addition of the acid will r-
equire about 1 hour.

After the acid has been added, the mixture is stirred for 2 hours longer at 90-
100 degrees to complete the nitration. Two layers seperate on standing. The upp-
er layer consists largely of dinitrotoluene (DNT), but probobly contains a cert-
ain amount of TNT. The trinitration in the laboratory is converniently carried 
out without separating the DNT from the spent acid.

While the dinitration mixture is stirred actively at a temperature of about 90 
degrees, 145 grams of fuming sulfuric aced (oleum containing 15% free SO3) is a-
dded slowly by pouring from a beaker. A mixed acid, composed of 72.5 grams each 
of nitric acid (d. 1.50) and the 15% oleum, is now added drop by drop with good 
agitation while the heat of the reaction maintains the temperature at 100-115 d-
egrees. After about three-quarters of the acid has been added, it will be found 
necessary to apply external heat to maintain the temperature. After all the acid
has been added (taking 1 1/2 to 2 hours), the heating and stirring are continued
for 2 hours longer at 100-115 degrees. After the material has stood overnight, 
the upper TNT layer will be found to have solidified to a hard cake, and the lo-
wer layer of spent acid to be filled with cdata  bstals. The acid is filtered t-
hrough a Buchner funnel (without filter paper), and the cake is broken up and w-
ashed with water on the same filter to remove excess of acid. The spent acid co-
ntains considerable amounts of TNT in solution; this is precipitated by pouring 
the acid into a large volume of water, filtered off, rinsed with water, and add-
ed to the main batch. All the of the product is washed three or four times by a-
gitating it vigorously with hot water under which it is melted.

After the last washing, the TNT is  granulated by allowing it to cool slowly un-
der hot water while the stirring is continued. The product, filtered off and dr-
ied at ordinary room temperature, is equal to a good commercial sample of crude 
TNT. It may be purified by dissolving in warm alcohol at 60 degrees and allowing
to cool slowly, or it may be purified by digesting with 5 times its weight of 5%
sodium hydrogen sulfite solution at 90 degrees for half an hour with vigorous s-
tirring, washing with hot water until the washings are colorless, and finally g-
ranulating as before. The product of this last treatment is equal to a good com-
mercial sample of purified TNT. Pure ALPHA-TNT, melting point 80.8 degrees, may 
be procured by recrystallizing this material once from nitric acid (d. 1.42) and
once from alcohol.

                                Flash Powder

Reagents:
-   KNO3  50%     (by weight)
-   Mg    50%

Instructions
-   Grind the oxidizer (KNO3, KClO3, KMnO4, KClO4 etc.) separately.
    NEVER grind or sift the mixed composition.
-   Mix the composition on a large paper sheet, by rolling the composition back 
    and forth.
-   Do not store flash compositions, especially any containing Mg.
-   Make very small quantities at first, so you can appreciate the power of such
    mixtures.

It is very important to have the KNO3 very dry, if evolution of ammonia is obse-
rved then the KNO3 has water in it. Very pure and dry KNO3 is needed. KClO3 with
Mg or Al metal powders works very well. Many hands, faces and lives have been l-
ost with such compositions. KMnO4 with Mg or Al is also an extremely powerful f-
lash composition. KClO4 with Al is generally found in commercial fireworks, this
does not mean that it is safe, it is a little safer than KClO3 above. KÂ²CrÂ²O7 c-
an also be used as an oxidizer for flash powder. The finer the oxidizer and the 
finer the metal powder the more powerful the explosive. This of course will also
increase the sensitivity of the flash powder.

For a quick flash small quantities can be burnt in the open. Larger quantities 
(50g or more) ignited in the open can detonate, they do not need a container to 
do so.

NOTE: Flash powder in any container will detonate.

Balanced equations of some oxidizer/metal reactions. Only major products are co-
nsidered. Excess metal powders are generally used. This excess burns with atmos-
pheric oxygen.

-   4 KNO3  + 10 Mg  ==>  2 KÂ²O + 2 NÂ²    + 10 MgO + Energy
-   KClO3   + 2 Al   ==>  KCl   + AlÂ²O3   + Energy
-   3 KClO4 + 8 Al   ==>  3 KCl + 4 AlÂ²O3 + Energy
-   6 KMnO4 + 14 Al  ==>  3 KÂ²O + 7 AlÂ²O3 + 6 Mn   + Energy

Make Black Powder first if you have never worked with pyrotechnic materials, th-
en think about this stuff.

Potassium perchlorate is a lot safer than sodium/potassium chlorate.




                        Ammonium TriIodide Crystals                         

Ammonium triiodide crystals are foul-smelling purple colored crystals that deco-
mpose under the slightest amount of heat, friction, or shock, if they are made 
with the purest ammonia (ammonium hydroxide) and iodine. Such crystals are said 
to detonate when a fly lands on them, or when an ant walks across them. Househo-
ld ammonia, however, has enough impurities, such as soaps and abrasive agents, 
so that the crystals will detonate when thrown, crushed, or heated. Ammonia, wh-
en bought in stores comes in a variety of forms.  The pine and cloudy ammonias 
should not be bought; only the clear ammonia should be used to make ammonium tr-
iiodide crystals. Upon detonation, a loud report is heard, and a cloud of purple
iodine gas appears about the detonation site. Whatever the unfortunate surface 
that the crystal was detonated upon will usually be ruined, as some of the iodi-
ne in the crystal is thrown about in a solid form, and iodine is corrosive. It 
leaves nasty, ugly, permanent brownish-purple stains on whatever it contacts. I-
odine gas is also bad news, since it can damage lungs, and it settles to the gr-
ound and stains things there also. Touching iodine leaves brown stains on the s-
kin that last for about a week, unless they are immediately and vigorously wash-
ed off. While such a compound would have little use to a serious terrorist, a v-
andal could utilize them in damaging property.  Or, a terrorist could throw sev-
eral of them into a crowd as a distraction, an action which would possibly inju-
re a few people, but frighten almost anyone, since a small crystal that may not 
be seen when thrown produces a rather loud explosion.

Ammonium triiodide crystals could be produced in the following manner:

Materials:
-   Iodine crystals
-   Clear ammonia (ammonium hydroxide, for the suicidal)

Equipment:
-   Funnel and filter paper
-   Paper towels
-   Two throw-away glass jars
-   Place about two teaspoons of iodine into one of the glass jars. The jars mu-
    st both be thrown away because they will never be clean again.
-   Add enough ammonia to completely cover the iodine.
-   Place the funnel into the other jar, and put the filter paper in the funnel.
    The technique for putting filter paper in a funnel is taught in every basic 
    chemistry lab class: fold the circular paper in half, so that a semi-circle 
    is formed. Then, fold it in half again to form a triangle with one curved s-
    ide. Pull one thickness of paper out to form a cone, and place the cone into
    the funnel.
-   After allowing the iodine to soak in the ammonia for a while, pour the solu-
    tion into the paper in the funnel through the filter paper.
-   While the solution is being filtered, put more ammonia into the first jar to
    wash any remaining crystals into the funnel as soon as it drains.
-   Collect all the purplish crystals without touching the brown filter paper, 
    and place them on the paper towels to dry for about an hour. Make sure that 
    they are not too close to any lights or other sources of heat, as they could
    well detonate. While they are still wet, divide the wet material into eight 
    pieces of about the same size.
-   After they dry, gently place the crystals onto a one square inch piece of d-
    uct tape. Cover it with a similar piece, and gently press the duct tape tog-
    ether around the crystal, making sure not to press the crystal itself. Fina-
    lly, cut away most of the excess duct tape with a pair of scissors, and sto-
    re the crystals in a cool dry safe place. They have a shelf life of about a 
    week, and they should be stored in individual containers that can be thrown 
    away, since they have a tendency to slowly decompose, a process which gives 
    off iodine vapors, which will stain whatever they settle on. One possible w-
    ay to increase their shelf life is to store them in airtight containers. To 
    use them, simply throw them against any surface or place them where they wi-
    ll be stepped on or crushed.




                            Ammonium Nitrate

Instructions:
-   Pour nitric acid into a large flask in an ice bath.
-   Then, pour ammonia (careful).
-   SLOWLY dry the liquids away. There would be a fine powder formed, which is 
    ammonium nitrate. It must be kept in an airtight container, because of its 
    tendency to pick up water from the air.





                        NitroCellulose (Guncotton)

Reagents:
-   Cotton (Cellulose)
-   Concentrated Nitric Acid
-   Concentrated Sulfuric Acid
-   Distilled Water
-   Blue Litmus Paper

Instructions:
-   Pour 10 cc of concentrated sulfuric acid into the beaker. Add to this 10 cc 
    of concentrated nitric acid.
-   Immediately add 0Â½ gm of cotton, and allow it to soak for exactly 3 minutes.
-   Remove the nitrocotton, and transfer it to a beaker of distilled water to w-
    ash it in.
-   Allow the material to dry, and then re-wash it.
-   After the cotton is neutral when tested with litmus paper, it is ready to be
    dried and stored.




                Picric Acid (Tri-Nitro-Phenol / TNP) (Dangerous)

The main problem with picric acid is its tendency to form dangerously sensitive 
and unstable picrate salts, such as potassium picrate. For this reason, it is u-
sually made into a safer form, such as ammonium picrate, called explosive D.

Reagents:
-   Phenol (9Â½ g) 
-   Concentrated Sulfuric Acid  (12Â½ mL)
-   Concentrated Nitric Acid (38 mL) 
-   Distilled Water 

Instructions:
-   Place 9Â½ grams of phenol into the 500 mL flask, and carefully add 12Â½ mL of 
    concentrated sulfuric acid and stir the mixture.
-   Put 400 mL of tap water into the 1000 mL beaker or boiling container and br-
    ing the water to a gentle boil.
-   After warming the 500 mL flask under hot tap water, place it in the boiling 
    water, and continue to stir the mixture of phenol and acid for about thirty 
    minutes. After thirty minutes, take the flask out, and allow it to cool for 
    about five minutes.
-   Pour out the boiling water used above, and after allowing the container to 
    cool, use it to create an ice bath, similar to the one used in steps 3-4. P-
    lace the 500 mL flask with the mixed acid an phenol in the ice bath. Add 
    38mL of concentrated nitric acid in small amounts, stirring the mixture con-
    stantly. A vigorous but "harmless" reaction should occur. When the mixture 
    stops reacting vigorously, take the flask out of the ice bath.
-   Warm the ice bath container, if it is glass, and then begin boiling more ta-
    p water. Place the flask containing the mixture in the boiling water, and h-
    eat it in the boiling water for 1Â½ to 2 hours.
-   Add 100 mL of cold distilled water to the solution, and chill it in an ice 
    bath until it is cold.
-   Filter out the yellowish-white picric acid crystals by pouring the solution 
    through the filter paper in the funnel. Collect the liquid and dispose of it
    in a safe place, since it is corrosive.
-   Wash out the 500 mL flask with distilled water, and put the contents of the 
    filter paper in the flask.  Add 300 mL of water, and shake vigorously.
-   Re-filter the crystals, and allow them to dry.
-   Store the crystals in a safe place in a glass container, since they will re-
    act with metal containers to produce picrates that could explode spontaneou-
    sly.




                                   Dry Ice

Take a 2-liter soda bottle, empty it completely, then add about 3/4 Lb of Dry I-
ce (crushed works best) and (optional) a quantity of water.
Depending on the condition of the bottle, the weather, and the amount and tempe-
rature of the bottle the bomb will go off in 30 seconds - 5 minutes. Without any
water added, the 2-liter bottles will go often in 3-7 minutes if dropped into a
warm river, and in 45 minutes to 1 Â½ hours in open air.




                                 Smoke Bombs

The following reaction should produce a fair amount of smoke. Since this reacti-
on is not all that dangerous you can use larger amounts if necessary

-   6 pt. ZINC POWDER
-   1 pt. SULFUR POWDER

Insert a red hot wire into the pile, step back.

PEROXYACETONE
PEROXYACETONE IS EXTREMELY FLAMMABLE AND HAS BEEN REPORTED TO BE SHOCK SENSITIVE

MATERIALS:
-   4 mL Acetone
-   4 mL 30% Hydrogen Peroxide
-   4 drops Conc. Hydrochloric Acid
-   150 mm Test Tube

Add 4 mL acetone and 4 mL hydrogen peroxide to the test tube. Then add 4 drops 
concentrated hydrochloric acid. In 10-20 minutes a white solid should begin to 
appear. If no change is observed, warm the test tube in a water bath at 40Â°C. A-
llow the reaction to continue for two hours. Swirl the slurry and filter it. Le-
ave out on filter paper to dry for at least two hours. To ignite, light a candle
tied to a meter stick and light it (while staying at least a meter away).



                                  Chlorine
                                 
Mix ammonia water with Ajax. Since the chlorine is heavier than air, it will st-
ay down in there unless you use large amounts (don't!).



                                  Hydrogen

Connect two carbon electrodes to a 12V DC circuit.
Dissolve salt in a large bowl full of water. 
Submerge the two test tubes in the water and put the electrodes inside them.
Collect gas at the cathode.



                                   Oxygen

Get some hydrogen peroxide and manganese dioxide. 
Mix the two in a bottle, and they give off oxygen. If the bottle is stoppered,
pressure will build up and shoot it off.



                                   Iodine

Put the tincture of iodine in a metal lid to a bottle and heat it over a candle.
Have a stand holding another metal lid directly over the tincture (about 4-6 in-
ches above it) with ice on top of it. The alcohol should evaporate, and the iod-
ine should sublime, but should reform iodine crystals on the cold metal lid dir-
ectly above. If this works (I haven't tried), you can use the iodine along with
household ammonia to form nitrogen triiodide.



                               Laughing Gas

Warning: do not use plastic bags for inhalation. You WILL forget to breathe.
Warning: remember to breathe OXYGEN.
Warning: distill your ammonium nitrate first, using [m]ethanol.

First, dissolve a quantity of ammonium nitrate in some water. Then you evaporate
the water over the stove, while stirring, until you have a heavy brine. When ne-
arly all the moisture is out it should solidify instantly when a drop is put on 
an ice cold metal plate.
When ready, dump it all out on a very cold surface. After a while, break it up 
and store it in a bottle.
A spoonful is put into a flask with a one-hole stopper, with a tube leading into
a big plastic bag. The flask is heated with an alcohol lamp.
When the temperature in the flask reaches 480 F the gas will generate. If white 
fumes appear the heat should be lowered as the stuff explodes at 600 F.

When the bag is filled, stop the action and get ready to turn on.




                            Astrolite (Dangerous)

Supposedly the most powerful non-nuclear explosive (1.5~2.0x TNT). Astrolite is
detonated with a #8 blasting cap.

Astrolite G: Mix two parts by weight of ammonium nitrate mixed with one part by 
    weight 'anhydrous' hydrazine.

Astrolite A/A-1-5: Mix 20% (weight) aluminum powder to the ammonium nitrate, and
    then mix with hydrazine. The aluminum powder should be 100 mesh or finer. 
    Astrolite A has a detonation velocity of 7,800MPS.




                          Sodium Chlorate Formulas
Sodium Chlorate is similar to potassium chlorate, and in most cases can be a su-
bstitute. Sodium chlorate is also more soluble in water. You can find sodium ch-
lorate at Channel or any hardware/home improvement store. It is used in blowtor-
ches and you can get about 3 lbs for about $6.00.

Sodium Chlorate Gunpowder
-   65% Sodium Chlorate
-   22% Charcoal
-   13% Sulfur
-   Sprinkles of Graphite on top
