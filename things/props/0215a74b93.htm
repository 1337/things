<li><strong>You don&#8217;t talk to users.</strong> If you design entirely based on intuition without ever gathering intel from a single human being who might at some point in their life come into contact with your business, I&#8217;m sorry, but you just aren&#8217;t a user experience designer.</li>
<li><strong>You can&#8217;t identify your target audience.</strong> If asked <em>who</em> your site is intended for and you say anyone and everyone, you are wrong. If a product is designed for everyone, it works for no one. A user experience designer would know that and narrow the target.</li>
<li><strong>You don&#8217;t define the problem before trying to solve it.</strong> If your boss tells you what to build and you don&#8217;t start the project by first determining <em>why</em> &#8212; the specific pain point that people are currently experiencing that your product aims to eliminate &#8212; you&#8217;re a lackey, not a user advocate. Nine times out of ten, understanding the problem changes the solution dramatically.</li>
<li><strong>You can&#8217;t articulate your users&#8217; goals.</strong> Maybe you <em>kinda</em> get the problem people are having, but unless you can communicate (in your own words) the objectives your target users are trying to accomplish both in their lives and their work, how can you craft a solution that will truly support their efforts?</li>
<li><strong>You design in a vacuum.</strong> No user experience designer works alone, so if you are, you aren&#8217;t one. Even a <a href="http://www.ugleah.com/ux-team-of-one/">UX team of one</a> relies on stakeholders, visual designers, developers, marketers, the guy in the next cubicle , etc. for feedback. A user experience designer knows the product isn&#8217;t meant for them, and always tests its effectiveness with other people.</li>
<li><strong>You make design decisions based on your personal preferences.</strong> If your coworker or client asks you, &#8220;Why did you choose to use checkboxes instead of radio buttons?&#8221; and your answer is, &#8220;Because I&#8217;ve always liked checkboxes better,&#8221; please dear God don&#8217;t call yourself a user experience designer.</li>
<li><strong>You don&#8217;t consider the business objectives.</strong> Surprise! If all you want to do is protect the consumer, join the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">ACLU</a>. A true user experience designer understands their company&#8217;s goals just as deeply as they understand their constituents. That allows you to determine which of the constituency&#8217;s needs should be addressed by the product, and make a case to the powers that be how doing so will positively impact the business in the long run.</li>
<li><strong>You don&#8217;t use UX methods.</strong> User interviews, usability tests, personas, scenarios, card sorts, affinity diagrams, concept models, sketches, flow diagrams, sitemaps, wireframes, prototypes, web analytics, A/B tests, the <a href="http://nform.com/tradingcards/">list</a> <a href="http://www.usabilityfirst.com/glossary/usability-methods/">goes</a> <a href="http://www.xdstrategy.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/researchmethods3d1.png">on</a> <a href="http://www.uxtechniques.com/">and</a> <a href="http://www.allaboutux.org/all-methods">on</a>. If you don&#8217;t have a systematic approach for articulating what you learn about your users to others on your team, or even a loose process to iterate on your ideas for what they&#8217;ll experience, you might be trying but you aren&#8217;t a user experience designer.</li>
<li><strong>You don&#8217;t design for conditions and edge cases.</strong> If you map out best-case scenarios and how-we-want-it user flows, but don&#8217;t take the time to craft branches and escape hatches for alternative needs, user errors, system errors and general curiosity, you don&#8217;t understand people very well and you&#8217;re not a user experience designer.</li>
<li><strong>You only think about the interface.</strong> If you&#8217;re focused exclusively on what the user sees and does on your website/mobile app/desktop app/kiosk/whatever, but never plan for how they&#8217;ll get there, what they&#8217;ll do when they leave, how they&#8217;ll come back, and most of all, how they&#8217;ll feel about it a week later, you&#8217;re a <em>user interface</em> designer, not a user experience designer. There&#8217;s a big difference.</li>
