<p>So you are not a psychology major, have an evil mind, and want to screw people up. One day, your blood floods with desires to ruin every psychologist out there. But what can you do? This article should give you some ideas.</p>
<p>For ease of writing, "the psychologist" is fictional, and is assumed male. You can call him Bob.</p>
<ul>
<li>Stand next to him and make funny faces to his subjects.</li>
<li>Sign up for psychology surveys that you do not qualify.</li>
<li>Sign up for psychology surveys with false information.</li>
<li>Sign up for psychology surveys with your friends, all of whom have the same devious intention.</li>
<li>Make noises, flashes of light, or anything that can screw up a memory experiment.</li>
<li>While in an experiment, bring along one of those mosquito repelling devices that make the annoying, high-pitched sound. Turn it on.</li>
<li>Use laxatives on rats in the control group.</li>
<li>Pretend to submit to psychology experimental conditions. Do the opposite of what the psychologist expects.</li>
<li>Assume the mind of the opposite sex.</li>
<li>If an experiment involves stereotypes, break some, keep some.</li>
<li>Bother other test subjects.</li>
<li>Leverage any knowledge in psychology that gives you the upper hand in these experiments, turning them into arguments in methodology or experimental setup.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, look up "demand characteristics" if you still want to know why you want to ruin a psychology experiment.</p>
