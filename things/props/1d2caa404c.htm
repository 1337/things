<ul> <li><strong>Get a gun</strong>, way ahead of time (like a whole decade beforehand).   <ul> <li><strong>Take a bus from your home to get your</strong> <strong>silencer, before getting your gun</strong> from some other shop. Don’t drive a car. You can also get on someone else’s car if you wish. Choose a small and quiet model.</li> <li><strong>Pick a small civilian gun</strong>. Choose models which fire common bullets to minimize possibility of tracing you from the bullets fired. I prefer <strong>Smith & Wesson Model CS45 Chief's Special</strong> with .45 <strong>ACP</strong> bullets. This gun is very small and cannot be seen inside your pocket.</li> <li><strong>Buy around 30 bullets</strong>. You’re bound to miss some on a mission.</li> <li><strong>Report the loss of your gun</strong> to the police. Say you got robbed at the bus station home. It was dark and the robber kept poking your ribs. Pay any potential fines. Now you’ve got yourself an unlicensed gun.</li> <li><strong>Disassemble the gun</strong>, and make scratch marks inside its barrel. Police can track the source of the bullet from the marks the barrel makes with the bullet. Create extra scratches to confuse the police. If possible, sand the inside of the barrel.</li> <li><strong>Make yourself a dust shield to cover the tip of the gun</strong> just to prevent invisible gunpowder from spraying on your hands after you shoot.</li> <li><strong>Wash your gun in gasoline</strong> to remove any fingerprints you left from the gun store. Dry it in some open space. Do not dry it near open grass fields.</li> <li><strong>Wrap your gun in disposable polyester cloth.</strong></li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Print two fake license plates</strong>. One for the front and one for the back. Do not take license plates off. Make the number easy to remember, so that any pedestrians will think they remember the number when they will report to the police. <ul> <li>White, long-sleeved shirt with blue long jeans, or the most common outfit in your region and time of the year.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Get your gear ready.</strong>   <ul> <li>Wear <strong>sports shoes</strong> of your choice, as long as it does not make noise on any surface, e.g. wood, plastic, marble, glass. Make sure your shoes don’t squeak. If your region has snow, tape a smaller piece of black cardboard under your shoes to avoid detection of footprint shapes.</li> <li>1 plastic bag</li> <li>Prepare a backpack which is made only from black nylon. Avoid any model which allows fabric to come off. You will need the following items. Place items into the backpack procedurally: <ul> <li>1 mask (you can wear it now if you want)</li> <li>1 piece of high quality cloth (the ones for glasses)</li> <li>2 pairs of transparent latex gloves. Yes, color matters.</li> <li>1 wrapped, silenced gun from before.</li> <li>1 pair of new leather gloves.</li> <li>1 pair of used leather gloves, purchased from ebay.</li> <li>1 pack of unopened, disposable raincoat.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Schedule the day.</strong> If you plan to kill at 3pm, arrange a shopping session with your friends at 3pm and that you’ll all be meeting in a shopping mall. Kill at 2:45~2:55pm.</li> <li><strong>Go to your target’s place</strong>. If the place does not have guards, ignore steps containing guards. <ul> <li><strong>Park opposite to your target’s house</strong>/apartment. Examine the building for <strong>backdoors</strong> and try them if you can.</li> <li><strong>Disable the telephone line.</strong> Some of the residents will be dialing 911.</li> <li>Go up to your target’s door.</li> <li>Open your backpack with your dominant hand. Do not let your backpack touch the ground at any time.</li> <li><strong>Take out one pair of latex gloves and wear them.</strong> Don’t touch the outside.</li> <li>Using gloved hands, wear another pair of latex gloves on top of that.</li> <li>Wear your <strong>leather gloves</strong> on top of that.</li> <li>Open your raincoat package and wear it.</li> <li>Unwrap your gun from the cloth. Unlock it. Put your cloth back into the backpack.</li> <li>Hold your gun with your dominant hand and your backpack with the other hand.</li> <li>Either knock on the door, or ring the door bell. <strong>Stand away from the peephole</strong>.</li> <li>If the target is not here, tough luck. Abort mission here.</li> <li>Regardless of who opened the door, point the gun at his/her <strong>forehead</strong> and shoot. Repeat until the person is dead.</li> <li>If that was your target, close the door quietly. Escape. Ignore steps below until it makes sense.</li> <li>Step into the building and eliminate anyone in your way until you reach your target. Kill him/her. If you cannot find him/her, kill off the entire building. Kill screaming women first to avoid alert from other floors. Then kill people at the counters because… there might be alarm buttons under the counter. Make sure you perform all the killing within a minute.</li> <li>When you’re finished, <strong>go out from the backdoor</strong>. Don’t open the door with bullets. They can tell how tall you are just from the height of bullet entry. If there isn’t a backdoor, exit from the front door. It should still be open, anyway.</li> <li>Exit the building. Take off your raincoat and your leather gloves, and put it inside the prepared plastic bag.</li> <li>Remove the cardboard on your shoes and rip them apart. Put the pieces inside the plastic bag. Tie the plastic bag and remove any air.</li> <li>Dump the used pair of gloves inside a rubbish bin near the building, used as fake decoy evidence.</li> <li>Enter your car and drive to the closest shopping mall. Avoid getting traffic tickets.</li> <li>Park in the closest shopping mall. Remove the fake license plate before entering the shopping mall.</li> <li>Dispose your plastic bag in some bin.</li> <li>Dispose your latex gloves in some other bin.</li> <li>Dispose your cloth in some other bin.</li> <li>Dispose your raincoat in some other bin.</li> <li>Dispose your mask, if you have one, in some other bin.</li> <li>Meet with your friends and <strong>do some shopping</strong>.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Get away with it.</strong> <ul> <li>Your license plate is not the same as what pedestrians saw. The dirt in your tire doesn’t really mean anything because you didn’t park in front of the targets house.</li> <li>You have no fingerprints left at the place.</li> <li>Your friends can proof you to be with them. You say you woke up at 12pm and took a shower before going out.</li> <li>Since your bloodstained tools are all in the plastic bag, you have no blood on yourself.</li> <li>Your footprints never appeared at the scene.</li> <li>It works best if nobody saw you, so please wear the mask.</li> <li>Note that you still have a gun with you, so please either keep it safe, or dispose it along with the items in the previously mentioned plastic bag prior to police investigation.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>
